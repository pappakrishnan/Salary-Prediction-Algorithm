Salary prediction algorithm implementation using Python

The python file consists of the steps implemented for data exploration, data cleaning, Machine learning model development and validation, 
and prediction. The variables provided are Job type, degree, Major, Age, gender, Distance to office, etc. I have implemented Random Forest algorithm to train and predict the target variable (salary).
